    "about": "Nader Bahsoun (b. 1995) is a self-taught multidisciplinary artist from southern Lebanon whose work delves into memory, identity, and the complexities of history through photography, archival research, and documentary methods. With a focus on photography, his practice seeks to uncover, recontextualize, and transform remnants of the past into dynamic narratives that challenge how memory is seen and understood.",

    "the-bleed-zine": "The Bleed Zine\nPhoto Serie\n\nNader deconstructs and examines the intricate layers of religious ritual and human emotion in The Bleed Zine, an ongoing photographic project centered on the Ashura ceremonies in Tyre, south of Lebanon. He questions traditional representations of this significant event, focusing on the collective expressions of devotion, grief, and solidarity.\nThrough black-and-white imagery and deliberate cropping techniques, he brings viewers intimately close to details that often go unnoticed— This approach offers a critical yet compassionate exploration of human expression and the fluid dynamics of the crowd.\nThe Bleed Zine unfolds as a study of movement and human expression, inviting viewers to discover the profound depths of a ritual that resonates far beyond its geographic origins.",
    "jal-el-bahr": "Jal El Bahr (Film)Jal el Bahr is a personal essai that retraces the history of a 1960’s domain in the South of Lebanon and the family it belongs to. Between reminiscing and feeling of loss, the documentary shifts into a metaphorical universe by illustrating the story through living pictures, discretely unveiling the unspoken that might have led to its perdition.\n\nDirected by Racha Baroud\nDirector of Photography Nader Bahsoun\nSound Engineer Tatiana el Dahdah",
    "shabah-el-rih": "Shabah El Rih\n\nLe Grand Théâtre des Mille et Une Nuits is a historical landmark in the center of Beirut. Built in the late 1920s, it played host to international performances, films and was an icon of contemporary Middle Eastern culture. After the 1975 civil war, the building suffered structural damage and was eventually boardd up and forgotten. There was no attempt to revive the theater until the people’s revolution of 2019, which led to its barriers finally being pulled down.",
    "three-decades-and-a-climax": "Three Decades and a Climax\nA Photographic Reflection on Lebanon’s 2019 Uprising\n\nThis photographic project documents a pivotal moment in Lebanon’s recent history: the 2019 uprising, a spontaneous and nationwide protest movement that erupted after three decades of systemic corruption, political stagnation, and social decay. Sparked by a proposed tax on WhatsApp calls, the protests quickly evolved into a larger, unified cry against decades of mismanagement by a sectarian ruling elite that had long manipulated power-sharing to maintain their grip on the country.\nThrough intimate street photography, this project captures the collective pulse of a nation reclaiming its voice—young and old, from all sects and regions, occupying public squares and chanting for dignity, justice, and real change. The uprising was not merely political; it was deeply personal—a rupture in the public’s tolerance for humiliation, economic disenfranchisement, and eroded social trust.\nAs the protests unfolded, the underlying fragility of the Lebanese state became increasingly evident. What followed was one of the worst economic collapses in modern history: the national currency lost over 90% of its value, banks froze citizens’ savings, and poverty rates soared. Yet in the face of despair, the people’s presence in the streets marked a rare and powerful assertion of agency.\nThree Decades and a Climax is not only a visual archive—it is a meditation on resistance, hope, and the role of collective memory in shaping national identity. The images in this series serve as both testimony and mirror: documenting the fever of revolt while inviting the viewer to reflect on what remains after the chants fade and the streets empty.",
    "snakes-and-ladders": "SNAKES & LADDERS\n\nSnakes and Ladders is an imaginary excursion, examining darkness, metaphorically, sensorially and symbolically. Hopelessly powerless bodies move, scan a dying city, try to read the future in the dark. The film creates a duality between a human body and a concrete building - attempting to open pathways of perception by melting the fortifications of our constructed meanings – by observing matter and thought, in their raw form. In darkness, we construct, in light we deconstruct.\n\nCommissioned by MAQAMAT for BIPOD 2022, the film was screened at Sursok Palace as part of Cameras of October.\nSelected for screening at Cinedans FEST '22 and was featured in the International Short Film Competition.",
    "unhearable-voices": "UNHEARABLE\nVOICES\n\nUnhearable Voices is an etude around the project What if those tears were not only mine?, a performance about unconscious heritage.\nThis movie was made in the frame of the Co-Labs residency in Amalgam Studio-Beirut in January 2022.\n\nDirected and performed by // Réalisation et performance :\nRacha Baroud\nAssistant director // Assistante à la mise en scène :\nRiwa Baroud\nCinematography // Directeur de la photographie :\nNader Bahsoun\nMusic composition // Compositeur\nCharbel Haber\nSound design // Design sonore :\nFadi Tabbal\nEditing // Montage\nNader Bahsoun",

    "i-was-naver": "I Was Naver – Experimental Film\nScreened at Museum Night, Kunsthal Ghent (Belgium), December 2024\n\nI Was Naver is an experimental short film that reflects on the layered political and emotional terrain of Lebanon through a personal lens. The film traces the arc between two pivotal moments: the liberation of South Lebanon in 2000, seen through the eyes of my mother, and the 2019 uprising, which I documented firsthand with my camera. Between these events lies a landscape of permanent failures—yet within them, elusive victories continue to surface.\nThe work interrogates how we perceive and process these shifting realities, especially when mediated through images that are themselves distorted, manipulated, or incomplete. It invites viewers into a fragmented visual narrative where memory, personal history, and national trauma collide.\nThe film was screened at Museum Night at Kunsthal Ghent as part of a program curated by Firas El Hallak in collaboration with United Screens for Palestine. Shown alongside the work of other artists and filmmakers challenging dominant narratives, I Was Naver contributed to an evening of intimate, political, and transformative encounters.",
    "southern-birds-project": "SOUTHERN BIRDS\n\nMedium:     Photography, video, altered archive\nFormat:       Ongoing project\nYear:             2025\n\nThe South carries within it both confinement and possibility. It is a place shaped by survival, by a history of resistance that has defined not only the land but the people who inhabit it. To be from the South is to inherit both its burden and its clarity, to be shaped by a force that is at once protective and consuming. Resistance exists as more than an act—it is a condition, a structure through which identity is negotiated. It asks what it means to endure, and whether endurance alone is enough.\nHere, family and home are continuously threatened, reconstructed, and redefined. They are tied to land but also to memory, to what is passed down and what is left behind.\nFamily photo albums are left buried in the rubble of bombed homes, remnants of airstrikes and destruction. Warped and ruined, yet not erased. A search for more begins—digging, uncovering, collecting remnants of personal and collective histories left behind, unclaimed, abandoned as if they no longer mattered.\nFor me, the child appears neither consumed by nor separate from the adult world but moving through it—imitating, absorbing, or reflecting something beyond themselves. There is an unsettling proximity between play and possession, innocence and something more elusive, what is remembered and what is imagined. History becomes something not to be escaped but rather held.\nThe images take on a pulse, refusing disappearance. This archive is not a ruin but a process of becoming. Evidence of persistence, of history reshaping itself, of a future waiting to be provoked."
